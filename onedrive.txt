 ############## COMPILE ###########

Raspberry Pi:

cd ~	# go to your home directory

git clone https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive.git
cd onedrive
./configure DC=~/ldc2-1.16.0-linux-armhf/bin/ldmd2
make clean; make        # this will take a couple of minutes
sudo make install

 ############## configuration ##########
mkdir -p ~/.config/onedrive
cd ~/onedrive
cp ./config ~/.config/onedrive/config

To edit the config file :  nano ~/.config/onedrive/config
Note: no changes needed to this config file, but read Readme documentation for more information

enable selective sync :  create a file named 'sync_list' in ~/.config/onedrive with one line : smartmeter
Note: after changing the sync_list, you must perform a full synchronization by executing :  onedrive --resync --synchronize

 ############## First run  ##############
After installing the application you must run it at least once from the terminal to authorize it.

You will be asked to open a specific link using your web browser where you will have to login into your
Microsoft Account and give the application the permission to access your files. After giving the permission,
you will be redirected to a blank page. Copy the URI of the blank page into the application.

Easiest to do this with a ssh connection from a PC and use the browser on the PC.

 ###########  automatic start ###########

OneDrive service running as root user via systemd

The onedrive.service has been adjusted to work systemwide

cp onedrive.service /usr/lib/systemd/system

sudo systemctl enable onedrive
sudo systemctl start onedrive

 ###########   Uninstall  OneDrive ###########

sudo make uninstall
# delete the application state
rm -rf ~/.config/onedrive

sudo systemctl stop onedrive
sudo systemctl disable onedrive
sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/systemd/system/onedrive.service

If you want to just delete the application key, but keep the items database:
rm -rf ~/.config/onedrive/refresh_token

If you want to remove downloaded OneDrive content
rm -rf ~/OneDrive

 ###########   usage ###########

onedrive --display-config   # display configuration

When running onedrive all actions can be logged to a separate log file.
This can be enabled by using the --enable-logging flag.
By default, log files will be written to /var/log/onedrive/
